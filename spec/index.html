			This document specifies a set of technologies that allow a Web
			developer to take control over the whole area that would generally be
			occupied by the title bar in an [=Isolated Web App=] running on ChromeOS.
			This mode is known as Borderless mode.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="sotd">
		<p>
			This draft is meant to serve as a starting point for the
			standardization process of Borderless mode and the technologies described in it
			might be migrated to other specifications on different working groups.

		<h2>
			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			Applications targeting non-mobile devices are hosted within frames that
			commonly have a title bar. A title bar is a UI element generally
			represented as a horizontal bar at the top of a window, bearing the
			name of the active program or the name of the current active document
			and and the [=window controls=]. Modern [=Isolated Web App=] applications can take advantage
			of the area in the title bar in order to display UI content to create a
			better UX.
		</p>
		<p>
			For installed web apps hosted within a user agent (UA) frame, it is
			possible to get some form of customization in the frame by declaring
			which type of [=display mode=] is preferred. Developers can select the mode
			that best meets the needs of the application via the [=manifest=]
			file's `<code>[=manifest/display=]</code>` or <code>[=manifest/display_override=]</code> member. However, these
			modes are limited and do not provide the same level of control over the title bar,
			therefore developers looking to create a completely seamless, native-like title bar
			for their installed application can't achieve this with the aforementioned
			members. The next most native-looking other <code>[=manifest/display_override=]</code> value is
			<code>[=display mode/window-controls-overlay=]</code>, which however still has the [=window controls=]
			out of the control of the web developer.
		<p>
			Together with the [=Additional Window Controls=] API, Borderless mode will
			provide web developers the full control of the appearance of their app,
			including the style of the title bar.

				Example

				<pre class="css">
					body {
						background: blue;

					@media (display-mode: borderless) {
						body {
							background: red;
						}

					#draggable {
						app-region: drag;

		<h2>
			Concepts
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<!--This could be removed if the explanation on WCO would be exported but maybe it's better to duplicate it-->
				<dfn data-lt="controls of the window">Window controls</dfn>:
				interface elements that the operating system uses consistently across
				applications to enable the user to perform certain actions to control
				the application. Common actions in the [=window controls=] include
				minimize, maximize/restore, and close buttons.
			</li>
			<li>
				<dfn>Additional Window Controls</dfn>: feature to replace [=window controls=]
				by calling the minimize/maximize/close etc APIs directly without the
				need to use browser's native window controls.
			</li>
			<li>
				<dfn data-lt="IWA">Isolated Web App</dfn>: feature for installed and signed web
				applications which are packaged as Web Bundles instead of being
				hosted on live web servers and fetched over HTTPS.

		<h2>
			Addition of new <code>[=display mode/borderless=] [=display mode=]</code>
		</h2>
		<p>
			This specification defines the following [=display mode=]:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<dfn data-export="" data-dfn-for="display mode">
					borderless
				</dfn>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				The web application opens without any title bar or native OS
				[=window controls=] visible and with the web contents extended to the
				whole title bar area. The app will also be able to specify
				[=draggable regions=] in the web contents to create a customized title bar.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			The <code>[=display mode/borderless=]</code>
			[=display mode=] can be specified in the
			<code>[=manifest/display_override=]</code> member of the manifest.

				TO DO: This is draft text for features that might belong in other
				specifications. This document might not be the final venue for some
				of the work specified in this draft. (manifest/manifest incubations)

		<h2>
			Defining <dfn>draggable regions</dfn>
		</h2>
		<p>
			To define which regions or elements in the title bar are draggable,
			this specification defines the CSS <code><dfn>app-region</dfn></code> property.
		</p>
		<aside class="issue">
			<p>
				TO DO: This is draft text for features that might belong in other

		<h2>
			Integration with CSSOM
		</h2>
		<p>
			This specification integrates with the [[cssom-view]] specification by
			patching the [=Window/resize=] viewport event.
		</p>
		<p>
			After step 1 of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view-1/#run-the-resize-steps">resize</a>
			algorithm, update the size of the elements with [=app-region=] CSS property.

			Security and privacy considerations
		</h2>
		<section>
			<h3>
				Security
			</h3>
			<section>
				<h4>
					Spoofing risks
				</h4>
				<p>
					Giving sites partial control of the title bar leaves room for
					developers to spoof content in what was previously a trusted,
					UA-controlled region. To mitigate the threat of spoofing, the feature
					is (at least for now) only targeted to be available for
					[=Isolated Web Apps=] and users will have to opt-in to the feature via
					a window management permission prompt and via admins’ force-installed
					apps policy. The title bar can be returned via App settings by
					toggling off the borderless mode capability. The origin will also be
					shown in the App settings.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>
					Out-of-scope Navigation
				</h4>
				<p>
					There are two already existing security limitations which affect
					applications being in borderless mode:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Installed web apps (PWAs)</b>: an indicator of
						when a user has left the declared scope of the app. When a user
						navigates out of scope, a black bar appears between the title bar and
						the web content, and it includes the following information:
						<ul>
							<li>
								A close button to allow users to easily navigate back into scope.
							</li>
							<li>
								A security icon which opens the security info popup when clicked.
							</li>
							<li>
								The origin and title of the site.
							</li>
							<li>
								In borderless mode, if a user navigates out-of-scope the web app
								will revert to standalone display mode (with a standalone title bar).
								When the user navigates back into scope, the standalone title bar
								will be removed again and the borderless mode enabled.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>[=Isolated Web Apps=]</b>: Opening external links is completely
						prevented and any links going out of scope of the app are opened
						in the default browser of the user.
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>
					Opening a popup from a borderless IWA
				</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Opening a popup to any other origin → The popup won't be in
						borderless mode (security risk if the following pop-up app would be
						malicious).
					</li>
					<li>
						Opening a popup to itself (same origin) → The popup opens in
						borderless mode, because the app has already got the permission to
						run in borderless mode.
					</li>
				</ul>
